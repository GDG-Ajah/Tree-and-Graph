/** Evaluate Division


You are given an array of variable pairs equations and an array of real numbers values, where equations[i] = [Ai, Bi] and values[i] represent the equation Ai / Bi = values[i]. Each Ai or Bi is a string that represents a single variable.

You are also given some queries, where queries[j] = [Cj, Dj] represents the jth query where you must find the answer for Cj / Dj = ?.

Return the answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined, return -1.0.

Note: The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.

 

Example 1:

Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]
Output: [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]
Explanation: 
Given: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0
queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ?
return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]
Example 2:

Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]], values = [1.5,2.5,5.0], queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]
Output: [3.75000,0.40000,5.00000,0.20000]
Example 3:

Input: equations = [["a","b"]], values = [0.5], queries = [["a","b"],["b","a"],["a","c"],["x","y"]]
Output: [0.50000,2.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]
 

Constraints:

1 <= equations.length <= 20
equations[i].length == 2
1 <= Ai.length, Bi.length <= 5
values.length == equations.length
0.0 < values[i] <= 20.0
1 <= queries.length <= 20
queries[i].length == 2
1 <= Cj.length, Dj.length <= 5
Ai, Bi, Cj, Dj consist of lower case English letters and digits.


Hint #1  
Do you recognize this as a graph problem?

// Solution 

/**
 * @param {string[][]} equations
 * @param {number[]} values
 * @param {string[][]} queries
 * @return {number[]}
 */

// 1. Build the graph
// 2. Traverse the graph
// 3. Return the result

var calcEquation = function(equations, values, queries) {
    const graph = buildGraph(equations, values);
    const result = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
        const [start, end] = queries[i];
        const res = dfs(graph, start, end, new Set());
        result.push(res);
    }
    
    return result;
}

function dfs(graph, start, end, visited) {
    if (!(start in graph) || !(end in graph)) return -1;
    if (start === end) return 1;
    if (graph[start][end]) return graph[start][end];
    
    visited.add(start);
    
    for (const neighbor in graph[start]) {
        if (visited.has(neighbor)) continue;
        const res = dfs(graph, neighbor, end, visited);
        if (res !== -1) return graph[start][neighbor] * res;
    }
    
    return -1;
}

function buildGraph(equations, values) {
    const graph = {};
    
    for (let i = 0; i < equations.length; i++) {
        const [start, end] = equations[i];
        if (!(start in graph)) graph[start] = {};
        if (!(end in graph)) graph[end] = {};
        graph[start][end] = values[i];
        graph[end][start] = 1 / values[i];
    }
    
    return graph;
}

// Time complexity is O(n + m) where n is the number of equations and m is the number of queries. We visit every node in the graph once and perform a constant amount of work each time. Space complexity is O(n) where n is the number of equations. We store the graph in a hash map which can contain up to n nodes.
